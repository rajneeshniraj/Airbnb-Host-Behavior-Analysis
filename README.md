# Airbnb-Host-Behavior-Analysis
The company wants to comprehend how host behavior varies across a variety of metrics. This project uses Airbnb data, which can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-k6_Mrz8BNubpnhVxvcuVJPBt-o8RDUg

The purpose of this analysis is to find trends in Airbnb host behaviour, and identify gaps in what listings offer versus what Airbnb customers are looking for.

The data includes listings, host, availibility and reviews and covers 2 major cities of 5 different countries China, Canada, Greece, Italy and US . The 'Listings' dataset includes information about each property and corresponding host, such as number of bedrooms, weekly/monthly price, instant bookable, and whether the host is a superhost. The 'Reviews' dataset includes the reviews text, listing ID, reviewer ID, and date. The host dataset includes information about each host, such as host since, host location, host response time, host response rate, host acceptance rate, host is superhost, host neighbourhood, host profile picture and identity varified or not. The Host availibility dataset

Company asked to understand the data and come up with the analysis:

So I analysed

a. Different metrics to draw the distinction between Super Host and Other Hosts: To achieve this, I use Acceptance rate, response rate, instant booking, profile picture, identity verified, review scores, average no of bookings per month, etc. explore a few as well.

b. Using the above analysis, identify the top 3 crucial metrics one needs to maintain to become a Super Host and also, found their average values.

c. Analyzed the comments of reviewers vary for listings of Super Hosts vs Other Hosts(Extracted words from the comments provided by the reviewers)

d. Analyzed Super Hosts tend to have large property types as compared to Other Hosts
